# FindMyPast - Coding Exercise

## How to
Clone this repo, open a terminal window and go to the cloned folder, just type in 

- npm install

This will download all required dependencies, fire up a local node server and a default browser window with two links:

- the running application (http://localhost:3000/)
- the jasmine testing spec (http://localhost:3000/tests)

## About
Exercise was done using the TDD approach with no javascript frameworks, just plain old VanillaJs.

Additional tools like gulp, node and jasmine were necesary for ease of development and "showing-off" a bit, for the scope of this kind of exercise just a single html file with some in-line javascript would have more than sufficed.

Project was started by doodling a minimal UI on paper and researching prime numbers and how to generate them using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number .


There are things that CAN be done better (which I am not really happy with right now)

- actual views for the user input
- generate DOM for each actor element based on code not copy/pasted html
- testing for given views
- e2e testing with a scenario 
- non-minimalistic design
- non-minimalistic renderer
- rendering performance

There are things that I have ommited on purpose (semantic html, commas etc.) not by lack of knowledge, just because I tend to focus more on solving the problem not making it pretty and correct at first run, there's always a re-factoring step after coding.
