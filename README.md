## About
Exercise was done using the TDD approach with no javascript frameworks, just plain old VanillaJs
Additional tools like gulp, node and jasmine were necesary for ease of development and showing-off a bit, for the scope of this kind of exercise just a single html file with some in-line javascript would have sufficed
Project was started by doodling a minimal UI on paper and researching prime numbers and how to generate them using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
